# Qraft technical tests

> Idea and tests are _heavily inspired_ (a.k.a "copy-pasted") from the awesome [Getaround (ex Drivy) 🚗 challenges](https://github.com/drivy/jobs) 🙏 😎 and from [Libeo's technical test](https://github.com/libeo-tech/take-home-test-inato).

If you want to join the engineering team at [Qraft](https://qraft.tech) you will most likely have to complete one of our tests. The recruiter will most likely point you to the most relevant test according to your profile. If not you can choose the test you are the most comfortable with:

- [Ruby](ruby/)
- [JavaScript](javascript/)
- [Frontend](frontend/)

You can check [our website](https://qraft.tech) to see what we do at _Qraft_ . We are **always** hiring talented people 😎.

## Why?

We believe our tech team should have a strong culture and build common conventions and coding style. We should be able to work together as a team. Ideally it should be impossible to know (except when _git blaming_) who wrote a given piece of code; we call this **Shared ownership**.

This culture and shared coding practices are meant to be evolutive and represent the current team in place. They must be opinionated, yet shared and represent the industry coding standards and best practices.

This:

- allows junior developers or newcomers to quickly onboard on the project
- improves overall code quality and decreases regressions
- eases performance tuning

> this exercice is a kind of [_kata_](http://codekata.com/), a simple problem that allows someone to explore deep engineering concepts; we'll hope you'll enjoy working on it and sharing it with us
